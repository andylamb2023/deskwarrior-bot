# README — Desk Warrior Bot (50 Stars) — Wellness + Anti‑Cheat + Leaderboard

This is a **Render-ready** MVP of a Telegram bot called **Desk Warrior** - *your office workout mate*.

- Sends periodic **exercise flashcards** (push-ups, squats, planks, stretches, walk prompts)
- Mixes in **wellness tips/warnings** (~25% of cards) - hydration, posture, eye‑strain, sedentary risk
- Lets users tap **Done ✅** to log completions (exercise cards only)
- **Anti‑cheat**: validates realistic completion time; early taps get reduced or rejected
- Awards **points** and shows a **/leaderboard** (per chat) for friendly competition
- Shows **/summary** totals for the day
- Offers **premium** via **Telegram Stars (50 XTR)** → custom intervals (30/45/60), more content, streak features (stubbed)
- Uses **python-telegram-bot v20** and **JobQueue** for per-user reminders
